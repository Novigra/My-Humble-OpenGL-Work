# My-Humble-OpenGL-Work
- OpenGL Core-Profile.
  
Note: The project is not a full program, and it is just me learning OpenGL, so if it's unorganized or the naming conventions are all over the place, that's why. :flushed:
## Libraries Used So Far ##
- GLFW
- GLAD
- GLM
- stb_image (Used for textures)
